1. polymorphism, Implements
   - polymorphism(many type) one object has a many type
   - if Circle class inherited by Shape class,
      Shape s = new Circle(); <-- possible (up casting)
      ((Circle).s).circleMethod(); <--- possible (down casting)

2. Dynamic Binding
   - when compile, static binding method.. now Object type based bounding

3. abstract class
   - if abstract method 0.. abstract class possible
   - but class has a more than one abstract method, must abstract class
   - when inherited abstract class, abstract method must be implemented

4. Interface
   - all interface's method is implicit public, abstract
   - variable implicit public static final
      - so interface variable's try value change, when compile error occur
   - object creation impossible, reference types possible
   * Provides an interface for collaboration
