1. overflow concept, test
2. auto casting, explicit casting
3. each data type's byte size check, Boolean class is not provide BYTES method
4. logical error test, solution: if explicit casting one data type. other data types auto casting
   (changing type)value or (changing type)variable  cast operator : use change data type
   - can be auto cast into a larger data type
   - can be Integer to Double
   - can be char -> int

   auto cast exception rule
   - The Boolean type exclude auto cast rule
   - byte or short data type operation is int
5. short + byte operation is unconditionally int
6. data loss test
